More and more users requested other ways of reaching the ARA community and I've
finally given in !

Until now, the only way of getting in touch was through IRC and I understand
that, in 2017, IRC is not for everyone.

## Seamless communication across IRC, Slack ~~and Discord~~

That's right, you can now reach us through Slack and Discord.
Both are linked to IRC so messages sent to one will be relayed automatically
to the others.

- To join us on Slack, use this [invitation](https://join.slack.com/t/ara-community/shared_invite/MjMxNzI4ODAxMDQxLTE1MDM4MDEzMTEtNzU1NTUwMTcyOQ)
- ~~To join us on Discord, use this [invitation](https://discord.gg/z2SGdc9)~~ (With over 30 people in the ARA slack and none in the Discord, we discontinued it.)

To join us on **IRC**, you'll find us in the **#ara** channel of the **freenode** server.
A web chat application to connect to IRC is available [here](https://webchat.freenode.net/).

### On Reddit

When I'm not discussing Ansible or answering questions about it in
[/r/ansible](https://www.reddit.com/r/ansible/), you might come across noteworthy
announcements about ARA that I post there.

There's a lot of discussion around ARA on /r/ansible and I will never get used
to users recommending other users that they use ARA, it's pretty awesome.

### On Twitter (new!)

You might have been following me on Twitter ([@dmsimard](https://twitter.com/dmsimard))
to keep up with updates I post about ARA's developments or new announcements.

That's cool but in case you'd like a curated feed that contains only worthwhile
updates about things relevant to Ansible and ARA, the new account to follow
is [@ara_community](https://twitter.com/ara_community).

## Other things

No, I'm not going to stand up a WhatsApp, a Snapchat, an Instagram and a Facebook
page :)

This is the best you've got for now !

Thanks for reading and see you online !
