ara-infra
=========

``ara-infra`` is a collection of playbooks, roles, tests, scripts, tools and
documentation helpful in the context of managing the CI/CD of ARA itself.

It is meant to do things like:
- Deploy the infrastructure server, ``infra.recordsansible.org``
- Deploy the website `ara.recordsansible.org <https://ara.recordsansible.org>`_
- Deploy `teamchat <https://github.com/dmsimard/teamchat>`_ for bridging ARA's Slack and IRC communities
- Carry common integration tests between the different ARA projects

If you're looking to use ARA Records Ansible for reporting on your playbooks,
the ARA documentation is available on `ara.readthedocs.io <https://ara.readthedocs.io/>`_.
